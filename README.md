The Digital Filter is a key component in digital signal processing (DSP) systems, used to modify, enhance, or remove specific frequency components of a digital signal. Unlike analog filters, digital filters operate on discrete-time signals using mathematical algorithms and logic circuits, offering higher precision, flexibility, and stability.In this project, a Digital Filter Design was implemented using Verilog HDL and simulated using the Cadence environment. The design focuses on basic Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter structures, which are the fundamental building blocks for many DSP applications. The Cadence SimVision tool was used to verify the filter’s response to input signals and analyze timing, data flow, and performance parameters.
